Bagels. The game.

A game similar to the popular MasterMind game. The computer will choose a
number that the player must guess. After the player makes a guess, the computer
will respond with the following:

1. _Fermi_: One digit is correct and in the correct location.
2. _Pico_: One digit is correct but not in the correct location.
3. _Bagels_: No digits are correct.


The core of this repository is the ability for the computer to guess the number
that the player has chosen.
